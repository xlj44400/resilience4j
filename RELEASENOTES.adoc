* Updated javaslang from 2.0.0-RC4 to 2.0.1

== Version 0.5.0
* Updated javaslang from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2

* Issue #33: Added the ability to 'force' state transitions manually
* Issue #38: A CircuitBreaker records not permitted calls when the state is OPEN and emits a event for each attempt. The metric "numberOfNotPermittedCalls" can be access via CircuitBreaker.Metrics
